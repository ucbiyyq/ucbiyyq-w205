We decided to use performance on the Complications survey as a proxy for hospital performance. A list of the best hospitals can roughly be seen as a list of hospitals that did well on the survey. Because the data dictionary was not clear about what score, denominator, etc meant, we decided to count the number of survey items where the hospital did better than the national rate.


The aggregate score is calculated as count of Better-than-the-National-Rate survey items, normalized by the number of survey items that could be counted for the hospital, per hospital. 


Note, the results only lists the top ten rows, which is not the top ten hospitals, thanks to ties in the scores.
