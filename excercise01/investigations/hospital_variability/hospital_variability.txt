We decided to use performance on the Complications and Readmissions & Death surveys as a proxy for hospital performance. We chose to interpret high variability when the hospital has more better or worse rating vs the national rate, and low variability when those numbers are low.


The aggregate score is calculated as count of Better-than-the-National-Rate + Worse-than-the-National-Rate survey items, normalized by the number of survey items that could be counted for the hospital, per hospital. 


Note, the results only lists the first ten rows, which is not the top ten hospitals, thanks to ties in the scores.
