Submission 1

How many rows are missing a value in the "State" column? Explain how you came up with the number.

There are 5377 records in the consumer complaints dataset that have missing (blank) State values. This can be seen when examining the State field with a text facet.



Submission 2

How many rows with missing ZIP codes do you have?

We have 4362 records with missing ZIP codes 



SUBMISSION 3:

If you consider all ZIP codes less than 99999 to be valid, how many valid and invalid ZIP codes do you have, respectively?

There are 34961 invalid, plus an additional 4362 blanks. That means we have 345175 valid ones.




SUBMISSION 4:
Change the radius to 3.0. What happens? Do you want to merge any of the resulting matches?

With radius 3, there are three suggested clusters. But only the Alaska cluster seems to be worth merging.



SUBMISSION 5:
Change the block size to 2. Give two examples of new clusters that may be worth merging.

With radius 2, there is only one cluster, the Alaska cluster.


SUBMISSION 6:
Explain in words what happens when you cluster the "place" column, and why you think that happened. What additional functionality could OpenRefine provide to possibly deal with the situation?

The clustering seems to keep running, with no end. Possibly this is caused by the strings being relatively longer and very different from each other. Perhaps OpenRefine can offer a better clustering algorithm. Or maybe a stemming algorithm that truncates words.




SUBMISSION 7:

Submit a representation of the resulting matrix from the Levenshtein edit distance calculation. The resulting value should be correct.
